AutoReplyLatamBot is a Telegram bot designed for group chats between an agency and its partners. The agency preconfigures the bot’s language and working hours. If a partner sends a message outside of working hours and no agency representative replies within 30 minutes, the bot automatically sends an out-of-office message (e.g., apologizing for non-working hours and providing support contacts or FAQ links). If an agency member responds during that time, the bot does not send any automated message.
